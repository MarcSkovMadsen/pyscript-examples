# Altair Example

This is an example of how to use `Altair` in `PyScript`, in this application we are using the _movies_ dataset from the `vega_datasets` package to create two graphs. The first graph creates a heatmap of the `IMDB` ratings and the `Rotten Tomatoes` ratings of the movies. The second graph creates a bar chart of the movie genres.
