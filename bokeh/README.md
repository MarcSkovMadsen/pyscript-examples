# Bokeh Example

This simple application uses both `Pandas` and `Bokeh` to create a simple interactive plot with `PyScript`. We are using circles with orange colour and a size of 15 to represent the data points at hardcoded locations. 

This application is a great start if you want to start with `Bokeh` and `Pandas` in `PyScript`.
