# Antigravity Example

This application is based on the famous XKCD comic [Python](https://xkcd.com/353/). It creates an `Antigravity` class to load a svg and then use PyScript to display and animate it.

It also shows you how you can import a file and use it in your Pyscript application - have a look at `pyscript.toml` to see how it's done.
